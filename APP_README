KICK 

An app for fetching data on soccer teams using API football-data.org

NOTES

• Methodology: MVVM (The interfaces between entities are delegate on one case and
   Notifications on the other (for the sake of example)

• Networking: Combine. Hence, iOS 13 is a minimum requirement

• Concurrency: GCD

• Xcode requirements: Launch and storyboard provided like Apple demands nowadays

• Documentation: None. Combine and MVVM modularity are pretty self-descriptive

• Overuse: due to free account - if firing a lot of requests on a short time span,
  server might issue a -1011 error (Server Side). This is intercepted on App, and response
  is putting a warning on the message console.
  A more thorough solution can be putting cache in Core Data and limit the
  the times user can launch networks call (trade-off for updated info), but
  this is beyond this drill limits and my time limits...

BONUSES

• An About section stack on right-top with some more info on team
• Note that name, fixtures and squad appear in the main color of the team..
